# Pop Ma Dice - Multiplayer Backend Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What's Been Implemented

A complete **multiplayer backend infrastructure** for Pop Ma Dice that enables players to compete against each other in real-time dice games on the Base network.

## 📦 Core Components

### 1. **Game Engine** (`lib/game-engine.ts`)
- ✅ Create game sessions (PvP & PvE)
- ✅ Execute game rounds with dice rolling
- ✅ Determine win/loss outcomes
- ✅ Calculate winnings and payouts
- ✅ Validate bet amounts

### 2. **Matchmaking Service** (`lib/matchmaking.ts`)
- ✅ Queue management for waiting players
- ✅ Intelligent player pairing (±10% bet tolerance)
- ✅ Stale entry cleanup (5-minute timeout)
- ✅ Queue status monitoring

### 3. **Player Management** (`lib/db-client.ts`)
- ✅ Player profile creation and updates
- ✅ Statistics tracking (wins, losses, winnings)
- ✅ Game history storage
- ✅ Leaderboard generation

### 4. **Database Layer** (`lib/db-client.ts`, `lib/db-schema.ts`)
- ✅ Abstract database interface
- ✅ In-memory implementation (development)
- ✅ PostgreSQL schema (production-ready)
- ✅ MongoDB schema (alternative)

### 5. **Game Types** (`lib/game-types.ts`)
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for all entities
- ✅ Game rules and constants
- ✅ Outcome determination logic

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Game Management
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/game/create` | POST | Create new game or join matchmaking queue |
| `/api/game/play` | POST | Execute a round in active game |
| `/api/game/state` | GET | Get current game state |

### Player & Stats
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/player/stats` | GET | Get player statistics and game history |
| `/api/leaderboard` | GET | Get top players by winnings |

## 🎮 Game Modes

### PvP (Player vs Player)
1. Player 1 creates game → joins queue
2. Player 2 creates game → matched with Player 1
3. Both players roll dice each round
4. First to win/lose condition wins
5. Winnings distributed to winner

### PvE (Player vs House)
1. Player creates PvE game
2. Player rolls dice against house
3. Win/lose on first roll
4. Instant payout

## 📊 Game Rules

### Win Conditions (Pop)
- [5,2], [2,5], [4,3], [3,4], [6,1], [1,6], [6,5], [5,6]

### Lose Conditions (Krap)
- [2,1], [1,2], [1,1], [6,6]

### Bet Constraints
- Minimum: 0.001 ETH
- Maximum: 1 ETH
- Matching tolerance: ±10%

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
cd pop-ma-dice
npm run dev
```

### 2. Create a Game
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/game/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "playerId": "player1",
    "address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
    "betAmount": "1000000000000000000",
    "mode": "pve"
  }'
```

### 3. Play a Round
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/game/play \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"gameId": "game_1234567890_abc123"}'
```

See `BACKEND_QUICKSTART.md` for more examples.

## 📚 Documentation

- **BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Complete system design and architecture
- **BACKEND_QUICKSTART.md** - Developer quick start with examples
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - This file

## 🔐 Security Considerations

Current implementation includes:
- Input validation for bet amounts
- Player ID verification
- Game state validation

Still needed:
- Wallet signature verification
- Rate limiting
- Fraud detection
- Transaction verification

## 📈 Performance

- In-memory database: Suitable for development
- Matchmaking: O(n) queue search
- Queue cleanup: Automatic every 5 minutes
- Leaderboard: Sorted by total winnings

## 🤝 Contributing

To extend the backend:

1. **Add new game mode**: Update `GameEngine` class
2. **Add new endpoint**: Create new route in `app/api/`
3. **Add new database operation**: Extend `IGameDatabase` interface
4. **Add new feature**: Follow existing patterns

## 📞 Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check `BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed docs
2. Review `BACKEND_QUICKSTART.md` for examples
3. Check implementation in `lib/` directory
4. Review API endpoints in `app/api/`
